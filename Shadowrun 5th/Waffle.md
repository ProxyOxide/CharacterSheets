## Background

Peter Banks was just out of school, living in a tiny apartment in Seattle and looking for a job as a hardware engineer. One night on his way home from a convenience store he witnessed a gruesome murder by a gang member. He ran home as fast as he could and locked the door behind him. His mind racing, he paced nervously around his apartment all night and all of the next day. Exhausted he slumped down on his couch and flipped on the trid. After some channel surfing, he was greeted by the bright colors and exuberant characters of "Project Magic Go! Go!" After 30 minutes he slept for the first time in two days. 

That was 5 years ago. He's barely left the apartment since then. Bills, however, gotta get paid, so he turned his knowledge of computer systems into a life as a professional hacker.
