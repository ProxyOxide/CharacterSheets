Commodore dira met with people on the top floor slightly after webfoot was there. That jerk with the drugged jedi stopped by the ship to annoy us. Spray has left his yacht unattended. It is time to burgle... Except that there's an HK on board. Now we're going to an after party for the pod race.

Spray wants me to find the rememberence. Gallandro already knows where it is. Maybe I can turn them against each other
